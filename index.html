				Children who are involved in sports are seen to be more proactive in class activities. Several children
				take up sports seriously in their children. The physical training classes that are enjoyed in the
				schools and colleges are to imbibe on the students a love for sports. The outdoors is an extremely
				important part of our lives. We must embrace it. Sports and games are two ways to express it. Games can
				be played indoors. Even working with building blocks or legos can be considered as a game. Hide and Seek
				is also a game. There are several other indoor games.
